Schematic Updates:
x Fix component attributes so all parts have manufacturer part numbers
x Fix component attributes so VALUE field does not separate parts of the same type
x   Using the Value field to name connectors makes working with the BOM *PAINFUL*
x Re-annotate to get sane reference designators
x Add fuses and part numbers to the BOM, not just the fuse sockets
x Add shorting jumpers to BOM? (used for setting microsteps, bypassing estop, etc)
x   TE 382811-8
  General cleanup & review all text and notes
x Generate schematic for CRAMP3 (3-channel add-on board)

PCB Updates:
  Place compnents
  Route board
    Manual pre-route as needed
    Auto-route remainder of board
x Update LED footprints to 1608/0603 package
x Locate or create screw terminal parts for 5.0mm and 3.5mm
x ATX power-on connector should be KK series latching connector (like ESTOP)
x Use screw terminal for 5V/12V power connector
x Switch to 0603 discrete components instead of 0805
x Proper mounting hole clearance for #4 hardware (6mm)
x Fix P8/P9 footprint & mounting holes
x Join adjacent screw terminals (P101/P107, P403/P405/P218/P219) on natural pitch (5.0mm or 3.5mm)
- Increase screw terminal pin clearance around BBB P1 (5V DC Power Jack)
-   Not needed, use 1/2 inch spacers between BBB and CRAMPS
  Preliminary placement of CRAMP3 add-on board to verify connector and mounting hole locations
x Switch fuse holders to Keystone
x IPC nominal footprints and silk-screen for SMT components:
x   http://landpatterns.ipc.org/default.asp
x   ...too bad KiCAD has no assembly or courtyard layers :(
x Make sure parts that should be on the back of the board are actually *PLACED* on the back of the board
x   BeagleBone P8
x   BeagleBone P9
x   BeagleBone Serial Console
x Shrink board to smaller than 100mm x 100mm
+ Move ATX power-on connector near 5V screw terminal?
+   Added to same connector as 5V and 12V power
+   Split back out into separate 0.1" header to save peripherial I/O space

x = done
- = don't implement
+ = selected choice
  = ToDo
